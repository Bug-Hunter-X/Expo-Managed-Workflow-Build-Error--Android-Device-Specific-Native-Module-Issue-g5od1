The root cause was determined to be incompatibility with the Android device's specific build environment.  The solution involved explicitly configuring the native module within the Expo project. This was accomplished by adding additional configurations within app.json, specifying the required native module and its dependency versions and potentially making modifications to the Android native module's build configuration to ensure compatibility.  For example:

```json
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.myapp",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "config": {
        "extra": {
          "NATIVE_MODULE_CONFIG": {
            "dependency1": "1.2.3",
            "dependency2": "4.5.6"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "plugins": [
    "expo-build-properties" // for Android build configuration if needed
  ]
}
```

Note: Replace `com.example.myapp`, "1.0.0" and the native module's configuration as necessary for your project.

This revised approach ensures the correct installation and linking of the native module, resolving the build failure on the problematic Android device.
