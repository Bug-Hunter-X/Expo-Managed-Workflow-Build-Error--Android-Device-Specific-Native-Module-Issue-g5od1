While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo's managed workflow and a specific native module.  The error message was vague, mentioning a problem with linking or a missing dependency, but the standard troubleshooting steps (cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, etc.) didn't resolve the issue.  The problem only surfaced on a specific device (a physical Android device), working fine on iOS simulators and Android emulators.
