# Expo Managed Workflow Build Error: Android Device Specific Native Module Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar build error encountered while using Expo's managed workflow with a native module. The error only manifests on a specific Android device, making debugging challenging.  The included `bug.js` file contains a simplified reproduction of the scenario (involving a placeholder native module). `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  `npm install` or `yarn install`
3.  Attempt to build for an Android device. (The error should occur)

## Potential Solution (bugSolution.js)

The proposed solution in `bugSolution.js` involves [insert a concise description of the solution here, e.g., adding explicit configuration to the `app.json`, modifying the native module's Android build process].  This may not be universally applicable, but it provides a starting point for troubleshooting similar issues.
